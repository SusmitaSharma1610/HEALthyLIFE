<h1 style="color:red;">SAY NO TO ADDICTION</h1>
<h2>Addiction</h2>
<P>Addiction is a brain disorder characterized by compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli despite adverse consequences.</br>
Despite the involvement of a number of psychosocial factors, a biological process—one that is induced by repeated exposure to an addictive</br> 
stimulus—is the core pathology that drives the development and maintenance of an addiction, according to the "brain disease model" of addiction.</br>
However, some scholars who study addiction argue that the brain disease model is incomplete and misleading.</br></p>

<p>The brain disease model posits that addiction is a disorder of the brain's reward system which arises through transcriptional and epigenetic</br> 
mechanisms and develops over time from chronically high levels of exposure to an addictive stimulus (e.g., eating food, the use of cocaine, </br>
engagement in sexual activity, participation in high-thrill cultural activities such as gambling, etc.)</br></p>

<p>Addiction occurs when a person becomes physically or pyschologically dependent on a substance, thing , or activity, leading to withdrawl</br>
symptoms when unavailable. Many people engage in addictive behaviours, but when these behaviours are abused,</br> 
it becomes a serious issue that may require intervention and treatment. </br>
The all consuming nature of addiction takes a physical, mental and emotional toll on the addicted person.</br>
It follows recovering from addiction takes time, dedication and support. Ultimately, the addicted person must be one to sum on resolution and</br>
determination to make a full recovery.</br></p>

<h1 style="color:blue;">What Are The Different Types Of Addiction?</h1>
<h2 id="A1" style="color:green;">1. Substance Addiction</h2>
<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmarketbusinessnews.com%2Ffinancial-glossary%2Faddiction-definition%2F&psig=AOvVaw1O2odv3hh2Qjdb8ikBe6Yn&ust=1625166790816000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAoQjRxqFwoTCIjpw8qIwPECFQAAAAAdAAAAABAz">

<p>The first thing that most people think of when talking about addiction is substance abuse.</br>
Drug and alcohol addiction is unique in this list, as the substances which are ingested or injected have a direct impact on a person’s</br> 
brain and body. Addiction to substances can be both a psychological issue, and a physical issue, which is why many substance abuse facilities</br> 
incorporate a medical component into the treatment regimen.</br></p>

<p>As with most addictions, a hallmark of substance addiction is the development of a tolerance. Tolerance refers to the experience of no</br>
longer being satisfied by the amount and frequency that an addict started out with. More and more of the substance or behavior is required </br>
to produce any high that is similar to the one experienced in the beginning. A sad fact of the matter of addiction is that no amount </br>
will ultimately satisfy.</br></p>
<h3>symptoms of substance addiction</h3>
<p>*Inability to sleep, awake at unusual times, unusual laziness.</br>
*Loss of or increased in appetite, changes in eating habits</br>
*Cold, sweaty palms; shaking hands.</br>
*Red, watery eyes; pupils larger or smaller than usual</br>
*Unusual smells on breath, body or clothes.</br>
*Extreme hyperactivity; excessive talkativeness.</br>
*Slowed or staggering walk; poor physical coordination.</br>
*Needle marks on lower arm, leg or bottom of feet.</br>
*Nausea, vomiting or excessive sweating.</br>
*Tremors or shakes of hands, feet or head.</br>
*Irregular heartbeat.</br>
*Runny nose; hacking cough</br>
*Puffy face, blushing, or paleness</br>
*Frequent rubbing of the nose</br>
*Frequent twisting of the jaw, back and forth</br>

<h2 id="A2" style="color:green;">2. Gambling Addiction</h2>
<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fraylozano.com%2Fwhat-exactly-is-a-gambling-addiction%2F&psig=AOvVaw02RQT3z-tAW6kGyrioImOi&ust=1625168109804000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAoQjRxqFwoTCOD6xKONwPECFQAAAAAdAAAAABAJ">
<img src ="https://raylozano.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gambling-addiction.jpg" width="600" height="500"></a>
<p>The quintessential image of the destitute gambler has been depicted in society since the invention of television.</br> 
He’s blown all his cash, he picks up a drinking problem, he is scared to tell his wife about losing their savings at the table,</br> 
and may even owe money to the mob. While Hollywood is notorious for exaggerating characteristics, many of these features of a gambling</br> 
addict are actually pretty true to life. Gambling addiction in the United States is prevalent enough that an anonymous support group has</br>
been created for it.</br></p>

<p>Data indicates that more males than females end up with a gambling addiction, though females tend to develop it more quickly.</br>
It can start out as a response to a desperate need for money, or it can begin as a result of feeling the high of the win.</br> 
Over time, the gambler will continue to risk more than he or she can spare, and will feel unable to stop the behavior.</br> 
Once there is an inability to stop gambling, even in light of negative consequences, it can be classified as an addiction.</br></p>

<h3>symptoms of gambling addiction?</h3>
<p>*obsessing over any type of gambling</br>
*gambling to feel better about life</br>
*failing to control your gambling</br>
*avoiding work or other commitments to gamble</br>
*neglecting bills and expenses and using the money for gambling</br>
*selling possessions to gamble</br>
*stealing money to gamble</br>
*lying about your gambling habit</br>
*feeling guilty after a gambling session</br>
*taking bigger and bigger risks while gambling</br></p>
<h2 id="A3" style="color:green;">3. Sex Addiction</h2>
<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mysciencework.com%2Fomniscience%2Fis-sex-addiction-an-actual-dependency&psig=AOvVaw10lz_0GyWhbw2F8dwSawQX&ust=1625169306307000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAoQjRxqFwoTCLi5kd-RwPECFQAAAAAdAAAAABAU">

<p>Sex is so important for human existence that some psychologists lobby to have it included on a list of basic needs that includes</br>
food, water, and sleep. For the sex addict, however, this satisfying of a human need becomes an obsession.</br>
It can take the form of engaging in risky sexual encounters, excessively watching porn, and participating in compulsive masturbation.</br> 
In extreme cases, it can progress to the point of the addict engaging in illegal sexual behaviors.</br></p>
<h3>symptoms of sex addiction?</h3>
<p>*chronic, obsessive sexual thoughts and fantasies</br>
*compulsive relations with multiple partners, including strangers</br>
*lying to cover behaviors</br>
*preoccupation with having sex, even when it interferes with daily life, productivity, work performance, and so on</br>
*inability to stop or control the behaviors</br>
*putting oneself or others in danger due to sexual behavior</br>
*feeling remorse or guilt after sex</br>
*experiencing other negative personal or professional consequences</br></p>
<h2 id="A4" style="color:green;">4. Food Addiction</h2>
<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcyrenelabs.com%2Faddiction-to-food%2F&psig=AOvVaw2Isp4tOqKyPzutz0-mLZgc&ust=1625253683516000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAoQjRxqFwoTCJir3rXMwvECFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD">
<img src="https://cyrenelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/food-addiction.png" width="600" height="500"></a>
<p>Identifying a food addiction can be tricky. Like with sex, eating is a normal and necessary part of life. </br>
Not only does food sustain our actual existence, eating it also releases pleasurable chemicals from our brain. </br>
While we chew our food, produced endorphins begin to course through our bodies, providing us with a mild form of natural high.</br> 
This pleasurable feeling is what a food addict typically begins to chase, and at a cost. </br>
Food addiction can lead to obesity and other health issues, and can wreak havoc on the addicted person’s self-esteem.</br></p>
<h3>symptoms of food addiction</h3>
<p>*Gorging in more food than one can physically tolerate</br>
*Eating to the point of feeling ill</br>
*Going out of your way to obtain certain foods</br>
*Continuing to eat certain foods even if no longer hungry</br>
*Eating in secret, isolation</br>
*Avoiding social interactions, relationships, or functions to spend time eating certain foods.</br>
*Difficulty function in a career or job due to decreased efficiency</br>
*Spending significant amount of money on buying certain foods for bingeing purposes</br>
*Decreased energy, chronic fatigue</br>
*Difficulty concentrating</br>
*Sleep disorders, such as insomnia or oversleeping</br>
*Restlessness</br>
*Irritability</br>
*Headaches</br>
*Digestive disorders</br>
*Suicidal ideations</br>
<h1 id="A5" style="color:red;">Addiction prevention tips:</h1>
<p>There are a lot of ways to prevent addiction. Most of them come down to self-care, relationships, and healthy coping skills.</br>
Even if preventing addiction isn’t your top priority, doing these things will benefit your mental health and allow you to live a happier,</br>
more fulfilled life. Here are 5 practical addiction prevention tips.</br></p>

<p>One of the best and most effective ways to prevent addiction is to educate the youth about the risks of drug and alcohol abuse.</br>
People who are educated are more likely to respond to</br></p>

<h2 style="color:green;">1. EDUCATE YOUTH</h2>
<p>situations in appropriate ways because they are aware of the risks that come with negative behaviors.</br> 
People may begin experimenting with drugs or alcohol at an early age, so educating youth is important. </br>
While this can be done on a community or school level, the best prevention education comes from parents and role models.</br> 
This opens up the door for open communication about complex issues, like substance abuse, that can be prevented. </br></p>

<h2 style="color:green;">2. TEACH HEALTHY COPING SKILLS</h2>
<p>Many people with substance use disorder began using drugs and alcohol to cope with unpleasant emotions, like stress, anxiety, or depression.</br>
Although substance abuse may relieve these symptoms temporarily, it isn’t a healthy way to cope. </br>
Instead, knowing how to cope with emotions in healthy ways may play a key role in preventing addiction.</br>
Some healthy coping skills to use instead of drinking or drugging include:</br></p>

<p>*Talking to someone you trust or a therapist</br>
*Taking a walk or run outdoors</br>
*Embracing creativity by writing, drawing, painting, or playing an instrument</br>
*Keeping a journal to express emotions</br>
*Deep breathing techniques </br>
*Prayer and meditation</br>
*Set aside time for self-care</br></p>

<h2style="color:green;">3. GET INVOLVED IN SOMETHING YOU CARE ABOUT</h2>
<p>Finding and participating in a passion or something you care deeply about will motivate you to live more purposefully and healthily.</br>
In addition, it will keep you busy and offer you a meaningful hobby to tend to while you’re feeling down. </br>
Whether it’s volunteering at an animal shelter, working with disabled children, climate activism, writing short stories, gardening,</br>
or opening your own Etsy store, finding your passion will help keep you focused on the things that really matter in life.</b>
People who find meaning an passion in life are happier and healthier, therefore, less likely to fall into the grips of addiction.</br></p>

<h2 style="color:green;">4. STAY CLOSE TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY</h2>
<p>Having healthy relationships is an important part of maintaining one’s mental and emotional health.</br> 
Not only do friends and family offer support when you are struggling, but human connection is essential.</br>
In fact, some people go as far as to say addiction is the opposite of connection, and that human connection is one factor that helps </br>
prevent addiction.[4] Humans are social creatures. Being able to lean on your friends and family for support is far better than turning to drugs</br>
or alcohol.</br></p>

<h2 style="color:green;">5. PRACTICE SELF-CARE</h2>
<p>Self-care is something so simple, but so easy to neglect. It doesn’t have to be a lavish day at the spa or an extravagant vacation.</br> 
Self-care comes down to treating the mind, body, and spirit well.  It means eating a nutritious diet, getting enough exercise,</br>
and taking time to relax or meditate. It’s easy to get caught up in the rush of everyday life, but it’s important to slow down and make sure</br> 
you’re taking care of yourself. If you don’t practice self-care, life can get overwhelming. However, by taking care of yourself,</br>
you will ensure that your mind and body is as healthy as it can possibly be – eliminating the desire to abuse substances.</br></p>
