<h1 style="color:blue;">What is yoga?</h1>
<p>Yoga is perhaps one of India's greatest gifts to the world. While the discipline dates back to about 15,000 years, it had gained popularity in<br>
India,and various other nations, only about two decades ago. Although this physical, mental and spiritual practice has amassed numerous<br>
practitioners inthe past few years.<br></p>
<p>"While yoga can be taken up by young and old alike, children below the age of seven are not advised to perform yoga asanas.<br>
Medical research suggests that children below that age might not be able to withstand the yogic practices.<br> 
The volume of their heart is smaller as compared to the luminal diameter of their blood vessels.<br> 
This means that their heart is not ready to endure the heightened requirements that yoga asanas require," says Dr Amrapali Patil, yoga guru and<br> 
founder of Trim N Tone.<br></p>
