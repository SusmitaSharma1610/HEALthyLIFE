<h1 style="color:brown">healthful diet</h1>

<h2>A healthful diet means eating nutrient dense foods, in the right quantities, from all the major food groups.</h2>
<p>People often think of “a diet” as a specific weight loss plan, but diet simply refers to the types and amounts of food a person eats.</p>

<p>A healthful diet must include a balance of several food groups, as no single group can provide everything the body needs for good health.</p>

<p>Making healthful food choices reduces a person’s risk of many chronic health conditions, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes,
and cancer.</p>

<p>There is a wealth of information available, so designing a suitable, healthful diet can feel overwhelming. That said,</br> 
a few simple changes can make a diet more nutritious and reduce the risk of many medical problems.</p>

<p>While some extreme diets may suggest otherwise, we all need a balance of protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins,</br>
and minerals in our diets to sustain a healthy body. You don’t need to eliminate certain categories of food from your diet,</br>
but rather select the healthiest options from each category.</br></p>
<h2 style="color:brown">1. Protein</h2>
<p>Protein gives you the energy to get up and go—and keep going—while also supporting mood and cognitive function. </br>
Too much protein can be harmful to people with kidney disease, but the latest research suggests that many of us need more high-quality protein,</br>
especially as we age. That doesn’t mean you have to eat more animal products—a variety of plant-based sources of protein each day can ensure </br>
your body gets all the essential protein it needs.</p>
<h2 style="color:green">Choosing Healthy Protein</h2>
<p>When it comes to making protein choices in your diet, quality is just as important as quantity.</br>
Here’s all you need to know to keep your body and mind healthy.</p>
<h2 style="color:green">What is Protein?</h2>
<p>Protein in your diet provides energy and supports your mood and cognitive function. It’s a vital nutrient required for building, maintaining,</br>
and repairing tissues, cells, and organs throughout the body. While it’s in many of the foods that we eat every day, for something so common it’s often</br>
a misunderstood part of our diets.</br></p>

<p>When you eat protein, it is broken down into the 20 amino acids that are the body’s basic building blocks for growth and energy. </br>
The amino acid tryptophan influences mood by producing serotonin, which can reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety and improve overall cognitive function.</p>

<p>Most animal sources of protein, such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy, deliver all the amino acids your body needs,</br>
while plant-based protein sources such as grains, beans, vegetables, and nuts often lack one or more of the essential amino acids.</br> 
However, that doesn’t mean you have to eat animal products to get the right amino acids. By eating a variety of plant-based sources of protein each day</br> 
you can ensure your body gets all the essential amino acids it needs.</br></p>

<h2 style="color:green">The health benefits of protein</h2>
<p>Protein gives you the energy to get up and go—and keep going. While too much protein can be harmful to people with kidney disease, diabetes,</br>
and some other conditions, eating the right amount of high-quality protein:</p>

<p>* Keeps your immune system functioning properly, maintains heart health and your respiratory system, and speeds recovery after exercise.</br>
* Is vital to the growth and development of children and for maintaining health in your senior years.</br>
* Can help reduce your risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</br>
* Can help you think clearly and may improve recall.</br>
* Can improve your mood and boost your resistance to stress, anxiety, and depression.</br>
* May help you maintain a healthy weight by curbing appetite, making you feel full longer, and fueling you with extra energy for exercising.</br></p>
<p>As well as being imperative to feeling healthy and energetic, protein is also important to the way you look.</br> 
Eating high-quality protein can help you maintain healthy skin, nails, and hair, build muscle, and maintain lean body mass while dieting.</p>

<p>While most people eating a Western diet get a sufficient quantity of protein each day, many of us are not getting the quality of protein we need.</p>
<h2 style="color:green">Good sources of high-quality protein</h2>
<p><b style="color:blue">Fish.</b> Most seafood is high in protein and low in saturated fat. Fish such as salmon, trout, sardines, anchovies,</br>
sablefish (black cod), and herring are also high in omega-3 fatty acids. Experts recommend eating seafood at least twice a week</p>.

<p><b style="color:blue">Poultry.</b> Removing the skin from chicken and turkey can substantially reduce the saturated fat. In the U.S.,</br>
non-organic poultry may also contain antibiotics and been raised on GMO feed grown with pesticides, so opt for organic and free-range if possible.</p>

<p><b style="color:blue">Dairy products.</b> Products such as skim milk, cheese, and yoghurt offer lots of healthy protein.</br>
Beware of added sugar in low-fat yoghurts and flavored milk, though, and skip processed cheese that often contains non-dairy ingredients.</p>

<p><b style="color:blue">Beans.</b> Beans and peas are packed full of both protein and fiber. Add them to salads, soups and stews to boost your protein intake.</p>

<p><b style="color:blue">Nuts and seeds.</b> As well as being rich sources of protein, nuts and seeds are also high in fiber and “good” fats.</br>
Add to salads or keep handy for snacks.</p>

<p><b style="color:blue">Tofu and soy products.</b> Non-GMO tofu and soy are excellent red meat alternatives, high in protein and low in fat. </br>
Try a “meatless Monday,” plant-based protein sources are often less expensive than meat so it can be as good for your wallet as it is for</br> 
your health.</p>
<h2 style="color:green">To avoid problems when increasing protein intake</h2>
<p>* Choose unsalted nuts and seeds, to reduce your daily sodium intake.</br>
* When shopping for canned beans, choose the low sodium versions.</br>
* Adding more protein to your diet can increase urine output, so drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.</br></p>
<p>Increasing protein can also cause calcium loss so make sure to get plenty of calcium (1,000 to 1,200 mg per day).</p>

<div style="background-image: url('https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp2067418.jpg');">
<h2 style="color:brown">2. Fat</h2>

<p>Not all fat is the same. While bad fats can wreck your diet and increase your risk of certain diseases, good fats protect your brain and heart.</br>
In fact, healthy fats—such as omega-3s—are vital to your physical and emotional health. </br>
Including more healthy fat in your diet can help improve your mood, boost your well-being, and even trim your waistline.</br></p>
<h2 style="color:green">Choosing Healthy Fats</h2>
<p>Think all fat is bad for you? Here’s everything you need to know about dietary fat, including how to choose good fats over bad fats and</br>
the power of omega-3s.</p>
<h2 style="color:green">What are dietary fats?</h2>
<p>Fat is a type of nutrient, and just like protein and carbohydrates, your body needs some fat for energy, to absorb vitamins,</br>
and to protect your heart and brain health. For years we’ve been told that eating fat will add inches to your waistline, raise cholesterol,</br> 
and cause a myriad of health problems. But now we know that not all fat is the same.</br></p>


<p>“Bad” fats, such as artificial trans fats and saturated fats, are guilty of the unhealthy things all fats have been blamed for—weight gain,</br>
clogged arteries, an increased risk of certain diseases, and so forth. But “good” fats such as unsaturated fats and omega-3 fatty acids have</br>
the opposite effect. In fact, healthy fats play a huge role in helping you manage your moods, stay on top of your mental game, fight fatigue, </br>
and even control your weight.</p>

<p>By understanding the difference between good and bad fats and how to include more healthy fat in your diet, you can improve how well you think</br>
and feel, boost your energy, and even trim your waistline.</p>
<h3><b>Dietary fat and cholesterol</b></h3>
<p>Dietary fat plays a major role in your cholesterol levels. Cholesterol is a fatty, wax-like substance that your body needs to function properly.</br>
In and of itself, cholesterol isn’t bad. But when you get too much of it, it can have a negative impact on your health. As with dietary fat,</br>
there are good and bad types of cholesterol.</p>
<p>* HDL cholesterol is the “good” kind of cholesterol found in your blood.</br>
* LDL cholesterol is the “bad” kind.</br>
* The key is to keep LDL levels low and HDL high, which may protect against heart disease and stroke.</br>
* Conversely, high levels of LDL cholesterol can clog arteries and low HDL can be a marker for increased cardiovascular risk.</br></p>
<h2 style="color:green">Good fats vs. bad fats</h2>

<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nutritionfact.in%2Fnutrition-facts%2Ftypes-of-dietary-fats&psig=AOvVaw1YTpb-_mJ7KpUU2K6UeTXg&ust=1625426896699000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAoQjRxqFwoTCNjttaLRx_ECFQAAAAAdAAAAABAO">
<img src="https://www.nutritionfact.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fats.jpg" width="1000" height="714"></a>

<p>Since fat is an important part of a healthy diet, rather than adopting a low-fat diet, it’s more important to focus on eating more beneficial</br>
“good” fats and limiting harmful “bad” fats.</p>
</div>
<div style="background-image: url('https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp2067418.jpg');">
<h2><b>Healthy or “good” fats</b></h2>
<p>Monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats are known as the “good fats” because they are good for your heart, your cholesterol,</br>
and your overall health. These fats can help to:</p>
<p>* Lower the risk of heart disease and stroke.</br>
* Lower bad LDL cholesterol levels, while increasing good HDL.</br>
* Prevent abnormal heart rhythms.</br>
* Lower triglycerides associated with heart disease and fight inflammation.</br>
* Lower blood pressure.</br>
* Prevent atherosclerosis (hardening and narrowing of the arteries).</br>
* Adding more of these healthy fats to your diet may also help to make you feel more satisfied after a meal, reducing hunger and thus promoting weight loss.</p>
<p><b>Monounsaturated fat</b> – good sources include:</p>
<p>* Olive, canola, peanut, and sesame oils</br>
* Avocados</br>
* Olives</br>
* Nuts (almonds, peanuts, macadamia, hazelnuts, pecans, cashews)</br>
* Peanut butter</br></p>
<p><b>Polyunsaturated fat</b> – good sources include:</p>

<p>* Sunflower, sesame, and pumpkin seeds<br>
* Flaxseed</br>
* Walnuts</br>
* Fatty fish (salmon, tuna, mackerel, herring, trout, sardines) and fish oil</br>
* Soybean and safflower oil</br>
* Soymilk</br>
* Tofu</br></p>
<h2><b>Unhealthy or “bad” fats</b></h2>
<p><b>Trans fat.</b> Small amounts of naturally occurring trans fats can be found in meat and dairy products but it’s artificial trans fats that</br>
are considered dangerous. This is the worst type of fat since it not only raises bad LDL cholesterol but also lowers good HDL levels. </br>
Artificial trans fats can also create inflammation, which is linked to heart disease, stroke, and other chronic conditions and contributes to</br> 
insulin resistance, which increases your risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has effectively outlawed the use of artificial trans-fats in commercially prepared</br> 
food and the World Health Organization (WHO) has called on other governments around the world to eliminate the use of trans fats by 2023.</br>
However, products made before the FDA ban may still be available for sale. Since products can be listed as having “zero trans fats” even </br>
if they contain up to 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving, it’s still important to carefully read food labels. Look for ingredients referred </br>
to as “partially hydrogenated oils.” These hidden sources of artificial trans fats can add up quickly.</p>

<p>If your country still allows the use of artificial trans fats, remember that no amount is considered safe, so aim to eliminate it from your diet.</p>
</div>
<div style="background-image: url('https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp2067418.jpg');">
<p><b>Trans fat</b> – primary sources include:</p>
<p>* Commercially-baked pastries, cookies, doughnuts, muffins, cakes, pizza dough</br>
* Packaged snack foods (crackers, microwave popcorn, chips)</br>
* Stick margarine, vegetable shortening</br>
* Fried foods (French fries, fried chicken, chicken nuggets, breaded fish)</br>
* Anything containing hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, even if it claims to be “trans fat-free”</br></p>
<p><b>Saturated fat.</b> While not as harmful as trans fat, saturated fat can raise bad LDL cholesterol and too much can negatively impact heart health,</br>
so it’s best consumed in moderation.</br> 
While there’s <b>no need to</b> cut out all saturated fat from your diet, most nutrition experts recommend limiting it to 10% of your daily calories.</p>

<p><b>Saturated fat</b> – primary sources include:</p>

<p>* Red meat (beef, lamb, pork)</br>
* Chicken skin</br>
* Whole-fat dairy products (milk, cream, cheese)</br>
* Butter</br>
* Ice cream</br>
* Lard</br>
* Tropical oils such as coconut and palm oil</br></p>
<h2 style="color:brown">3. Fiber</h2>
<p>Eating foods high in dietary fiber (grains, fruit, vegetables, nuts, and beans) can help you stay regular and lower your risk for heart disease,</br>
stroke, and diabetes. It can also improve your skin and even help you to lose weight.</p>

<h2 style="color:green">What is fiber?</h2>
<p>Many of us associate fiber with digestive health and bowel function. But eating foods high in dietary fiber can do so much more than keep</br> 
you regular. It can lower your risk for heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, improve the health of your skin, and help you lose weight. </br>
It may even help prevent colon cancer.</p>

<p>Fiber, also known as roughage, is the part of plant-based foods (grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and beans) that the body can’t break down.</br>
It passes through the body undigested, keeping your digestive system clean and healthy, easing bowel movements,</br>
and flushing cholesterol and harmful carcinogens out of the body.</p>

<p>Fiber comes in two varieties: insoluble and soluble.</p>

<p><b>Insoluble fiber</b> does not dissolve in water. It is the bulky fiber that helps to prevent constipation, and is found in whole grains,</br>
wheat cereals, and vegetables such as carrots, celery, and tomatoes.</p>

<p><b>Soluble fiber</b> dissolves in water and helps control blood sugar levels and reduce cholesterol.</br>
Good sources include barley, oatmeal, beans, nuts, and fruits such as apples, berries, citrus fruits, and pears.</p>

<p>Many foods contain both soluble and insoluble fiber. In general, the more natural and unprocessed the food, the higher it is in fiber.</br>
There is no fiber in meat, dairy, or sugar. Refined or “white” foods, such as white bread, white rice, and pastries, </br>
have had all or most of their fiber removed.</p>
<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foodsforbetterhealth.com%2Ffiber-rich-foods-30811&psig=AOvVaw2GHialv4OxawIrt_Xc0uoD&ust=1625428107314000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAoQjRxqFwoTCNigoOvVx_ECFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE">

<h2 style="color:green">The health benefits of fiber</h2>
<p>The latest figures show that nine out of ten Americans are not eating enough fiber—and people in other parts of the world are also falling</br> 
well short. Part of the problem may be due to the association with bathroom habits. Yes, fiber offers a healthy and effective way to stay regular,</br>
but that’s not the only reason why we should be including more in our diets.</br>
Many different studies have highlighted how eating a diet high in fiber can boost your immune system and overall health,</br>
and improve how you look and feel.</p>

<p><b>Some of the benefits include:</b></p>

<p><b style="color:blue">Digestive health.</b> Dietary fiber normalizes bowel movements by bulking up stools and making them easier to pass.</br>
This can help relieve and prevent both constipation and diarrhea. Eating plenty of fiber can also reduce your risk for </br>
diverticulitis (inflammation of the intestine), hemorrhoids, gallstones, kidney stones, and provide some relief for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).</br>
Some studies have also indicated that a high-fiber diet may help to lower gastric acid and reduce your risk for gastroesophageal </br>
reflux disorder (GERD) and ulcers.</p>

<p><b style="color:blue">Diabetes.</b> A diet high in fiber—particularly insoluble fiber from cereals—can lower your risk for type 2 diabetes. </br>
If you already have diabetes, eating soluble fiber can slow the absorption of sugar and improve your blood sugar levels.</p>

<p><b style="color:blue">Cancer.</b> There is some research that suggests eating a high-fiber diet can help prevent colorectal cancer,</br>
although the evidence is not yet conclusive. Diets rich in high-fiber foods are also linked to a lower risk for other common digestive system</br>
cancers, including stomach, mouth, and pharynx.</p>

<p><b style="color:blue">Skin health.</b> When yeast and fungus are excreted through the skin, they can trigger outbreaks or acne.</br>
Eating fiber, especially psyllium husk (a type of plant seed), can flush toxins out of your body, improving the health and appearance of your skin.</p>

<p><b style="color:blue">Heart health.</b> Fiber, particularly soluble fiber, is an important element of any heart-healthy diet.</br>
Eating a diet high in fiber can improve cholesterol levels by lowering LDL (bad) cholesterol.</br>
A high fiber intake can also reduce your risk for metabolic syndrome, a group of risk factors linked to coronary heart disease, diabetes, </br>
and stroke. Fiber can also help to lower blood pressure, reduce inflammation, improve levels of HDL (good) cholesterol, </br>
and shed excess weight around the abdomen.</p>

<h2 style="color:brown">3. Calcium</h2>
<p>As well as leading to osteoporosis, not getting enough calcium in your diet can also contribute to anxiety, depression,</br>
and sleep difficulties. Whatever your age or gender, it’s vital to include calcium-rich foods in your diet, limit those that deplete calcium, </br>
and get enough magnesium and vitamins D and K to help calcium do its job.</p>

<h2 style="color:green">What are the health benefits of calcium?</h2>
<p>Calcium is a key nutrient that many of us overlook in our diets. Almost every cell in the body uses calcium in some way,</br>
including the nervous system, muscles, and heart. Your body uses calcium to build healthy bones and teeth, keep them strong as you age,</br>
send messages through the nervous system, help your blood clot, your muscles contract, and regulate the heart’s rhythm.</p>

<p>If you don’t get enough calcium in your diet, your body will take it from your bones to ensure normal cell function,<br>
which can lead to weakened bones or osteoporosis. Calcium deficiency can contribute to mood problems such as irritability, anxiety, depression,<br> 
and difficulty sleeping.</br>

<p>Despite these vital functions, many of us are confused about calcium and how to best protect our bones and overall health.<br>
How much calcium should you get? Where should you get it? And what’s the deal with vitamin D, magnesium, and other nutrients that help calcium</br>
do its job? This confusion means that many of us are not getting the recommended daily amount of calcium and approximately one in two women</br>
(and about one in four men) over the age of 50 will break a bone due to osteoporosis.</p>

<p>Getting enough calcium in your diet is not just important for older people. It’s also vital for children, teens, and young adults since we </br>
continue building bone mass into our mid-20s. From then on, we can lose bone mass without sufficient calcium in our diets.</br>
Whatever your age or gender, it’s vital to include calcium-rich foods in your diet, limit those that deplete calcium,</br>
and get enough magnesium and vitamins D and K to help calcium do its job.</p>

<h2 style="color:green">Beyond calcium: Other nutrients for healthy bones</h2>

<p><b>Magnesium</b></p>

<p><b style="color:blue">Why it’s important:</b> Magnesium helps your body absorb and retain calcium to help build and strengthen bones and</br> 
prevent osteoporosis. Since your body is not good at storing magnesium, it is vital to make sure you get enough of it in your diet.</p>

<p><b style="color:blue">How much do you need?</b> For adult men, 400-420 mg daily. For adult women, 310-320 mg daily (more during pregnancy).</p>

<p><b style="color:blue">How to include more in your diet:</b> Magnesium is found in nuts (especially almonds and cashews), seeds</br>
(pumpkin, sesame, flax, sunflower), whole grains, seafood, legumes, tofu, and many vegetables, including spinach, Swiss chard, summer squash,</br> 
turnip and mustard greens, broccoli, sea vegetables, cucumbers, and celery. Reduce sugar and alcohol, which increase the excretion of magnesium.</p>

<p><b>Vitamin D</b></p>
<p><b style="color:blue">Why it’s important:</b> Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium and regulates calcium in the blood.</p>

<p><b style="color:blue">How much do you need?</b> Up to age 70, 600 IU (international units) per day. Over 70, 800 IU per day.</p>

<p><b style="color:blue">How to include more in your diet:</b> Your body synthesizes vitamin D when exposed to the sun.</br>
Spend at least 15 minutes outside in the sun each day and include good food sources of vitamin D in your diet, such as fortified milk, eggs,</br>
cheese, fortified cereal, butter, cream, fish, shrimp, and oysters.</p>

<p><b>Phosphorous</b></p>
<p><b style="color:blue">Why it’s important:</b> Phosphorous works with calcium to build bones. But again, it’s important to get the balance diet</br>
too much phosphorous will cause your body to absorb less calcium and can even be toxic.</p>

<p><b style="color:blue">How much do you need? </b>For adults, 700 mg a day.</p>

<p><bstyle="color:blue">How to include more in your diet:</b> Good sources include dairy, fish (cod, salmon, tuna), pork, poultry, lentils, nuts,</br>
and whole grains.</p>

<p><b>Vitamin K</b></p>
<p><b style="color:blue">Why it’s important:</b> Vitamin K helps the body regulate calcium and form strong bones.</p>

<p><b style="color:blue">How much do you need?</b> Adult men, 120 micrograms daily. Adult women, 90 micrograms daily.</p>

<p><b style="color:blue">How to include more in your diet: </b>You should be able to meet the daily recommendation for vitamin K by simply eating</br> 
one or more servings per day of broccoli, Brussels sprouts, dark green lettuce, collard greens, or kale.</p>

<p><b>Vitamin C and vitamin B12</b></p>
<p>New research suggests that vitamin C and vitamin B12 may also play important roles in bone health and the prevention of osteoporosis.</p>

<p>Consuming foods rich in vitamin C may help to prevent bone loss. Good sources include citrus fruit, such as oranges and grapefruit, </br>
strawberries, kiwi, mango, Brussels sprouts, and green bell peppers.</p>

<p>Studies have also found a link between vitamin B12 levels and bone density and osteoporosis.</br>
Good sources of B12 include seafood such as salmon, haddock, and canned tuna, as well as milk, yogurt, eggs, and cottage cheese.</p>

<h2 style="color:brown">5. Carbohydrates</h2>
<p>are one of your body’s main sources of energy. But most should come from complex, unrefined carbs (vegetables, whole grains, fruit) rather than </br>
sugars and refined carbs. Cutting back on white bread, pastries, starches, and sugar can prevent rapid spikes in blood sugar, fluctuations in</br>
mood and energy, and a build-up of fat, especially around your waistline. </p>

<h2 style="color:green">5. What are refined, simple, or “bad” carbs?</h2>
<p>Bad or simple carbohydrates include sugars and refined grains that have been stripped of all bran, fiber, and nutrients, such as white bread,</br>
pizza dough, pasta, pastries, white flour, white rice, sweet desserts, and many breakfast cereals. </br>
They digest quickly and their high glycemic index causes unhealthy spikes in blood sugar levels. They can also cause fluctuations in mood and</br> 
energy and a build-up of fat, especially around your waistline.</p>

<p>When you eat refined or simple carbs, your bloodstream is flooded with sugar which triggers a surge of insulin to clear the sugar from your blood.</br>
All this insulin can leave you feeling hungry soon after a meal, often craving more sugary carbs. This can cause you to overeat, put on weight,</br>
and over time lead to insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes. Diets high in refined carbs and sugar have also been linked to high blood pressure,</br>
heart disease, obesity, hyperactivity, mood disorders, and even suicide in teenagers.</p>

<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sidneyhealth.org%2FBlog%2FWhat-are-Carbohydrates-&psig=AOvVaw3adwZPU9k-wgu38ZhF0Vgj&ust=1625473700901000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAoQjRxqFwoTCIisx9H_yPECFQAAAAAdAAAAABAO">

<h2 style="color:green">Good carbs vs. bad carbs</h2>
<p>Carbohydrates are one of your body’s main sources of energy. Health organizations such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 
recommend that 45 to 65 percent of your daily calories should come from carbohydrates. However, the majority of these should be from complex,
unrefined carbs rather than refined carbs (including starches such as potatoes and corn).</p>

<p>Unlike simple carbs, complex carbohydrates are digested slowly, causing a gradual rise in blood sugar. They’re usually high in nutrients and
fiber, which can help prevent serious disease, aid with weight-loss, and improve your energy levels.
In general, “good” carbohydrates have a lower glycemic load and can even help guard against type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular problems in the 
future.</p>

<p><b>Good carbs include:</b></p>

<p><b style="color:green">Unrefined whole grains –</b> whole wheat or multigrain bread, brown rice, barley, quinoa, bran cereal, oatmeal.</p>

<p><b style="color:green"> Non-starchy vegetables – </b>spinach, green beans, Brussels sprouts, celery, tomatoes.</p>

<p><b style="color:green">Legumes – </b>kidney beans, baked beans, peas, lentils.</p>

<p><b style="color:green">Nuts – </b>peanuts, cashews, walnuts.</p>
